# YOLOv8 Weed Detection AI

This project builds an AI-powered weed detection system using Python, OpenCV, YOLOv8, and other libraries.  It detects weeds in garden images and videos, labeling them with bounding boxes.

### 📦 Dataset Overview
- weed_dataset - contains '.jpg' images with weeds, each labeled with bounding boxes {'.txt' in YOLO format}
- not_weed_dataset - contains '.jpg' images with no weeds.  Each image has an empty '.txt' label file.        

All labels were created in Pascal VOC .xml format and converted to YOLO .txt format.

## 🔧 Features

### 'org.py' - Dataset organizer:
- Collects all `.jpg` and corresponding `.txt` files from both datasets.
- Splits the data into:
  - **80% training**
  - **20% validation**
- Outputs a YOLOv8-compliant structure inside `dataset/`.

### `data.yaml` — Training Configuration
- Specifies:
  - Paths to training and validation folders
  - It specifies that the training images are in images/train.
  - It also specifies that the validation images are in images/val.
  - Class names (only one: `"weed"`)


## 🎥 Inference on Videos
### `detect_weed.py`:
- Loads the trained YOLOv8 model (default: `runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt`)
- Opens the input video file
- Processes the video **frame by frame**
- Draws bounding boxes for each frame
- Saves the output video as `output.avi`
- Optionally displays the live output window
